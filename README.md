##About the Forsure File
The folder named forsure is a DNS system,with a TCPClient,a Local Server and five Remote Server(Root,TLD,SLD).
I write it for ￥2000，I don't know if it can worth this price ,so I got ￥1000 at last.
Because I haven't wrote codes for nearly a year,since I started my TOR project.
For some kinds of reasons,I didn't write any header files and makefiles. So it can be used with a gcc command.
It is a prototype ,which I'm not so satisfied with it.So if anyone see it ,Please ignore it.I'm just a loser.
